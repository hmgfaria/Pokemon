# DeepPok√©mon
Pok√©mon is a japanese media franchise centered on fictional creatures called "Pok√©mon", which humans, known as Pok√©mon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport.

## üìç Objectives
The purpose of this repository is to explore and analyse the PokeWorld, while learning and improving Data Science, Deep Learning and Computer Vision skills. As such, the implementations presented here may not be the most elegant ones, but bear with me as I *"Catch'em All!"*

I will split this in 3 main objectives, showcasing different complexity:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**
  
  Focusing on exploring Pandas, scikit and matplotlib for data processing and visualizations. 
  
  Some questions I can try to address:
  
    - Which are the strongest Pokemons?
    - Which starter is better?
    - Which types are strongest or more common?
    - Is there any correlation between the stats and the Type? (as I child I always thought Fire Pokemons were the best)
    
- **Classification**

  As a second step I want to try and perform some classification task with ML or DL. Still have to check available data, but here are some ideas:

    - Predict which pokemon will win a combat.
    - Classify legendaries and non-legendaries
    - Predict type from stats
    
- **Computer Vision**

  Not sure if this will be possible, but the ultimate goal would be to develop a virtual Pokedex! Show it an image, identify the Pokemon and show its stats.

## üì¶ Datasets
I will use Kaggle datasets, which will be included here as I go along
